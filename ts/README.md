# @dsaveil/theveil

## Status

Pre-1.0. The `TheVeil` client ships construction-time `apiKey` validation,
`baseUrl` normalization with scheme guards, per-call timeout composition,
the `client.messages()` proxy endpoint, `client.verifyCertificate()` for
witness-signature verification, and five typed error classes. The public
API surface is still in flux — see [CHANGELOG](../CHANGELOG.md).

## Install

```sh
npm install @dsaveil/theveil
```

(not yet published)

## Verify a Veil Certificate

`client.verifyCertificate(cert, keys)` verifies the Veil witness's Ed25519
signature over a certificate's canonical JSON core fields. The caller
supplies the witness identity (expected `witnessKeyId` label and raw 32-byte
`witnessPublicKey`) out of band — the SDK never fetches or bakes in keys.

External RFC 3161 timestamp verification and Sigstore Rekor transparency-
log verification are **not** performed by this release. They land in a
follow-up release pending gateway work. Until then, `anchorStatus` and
`overallVerdict` are surfaced as pass-through metadata for observability,
not independently verified.

```ts
import { TheVeil, TheVeilCertificateError } from '@dsaveil/theveil';

const client = new TheVeil({ apiKey: process.env.THEVEIL_API_KEY! });

// Obtain the certificate out of band (fetch helper lands in a later arc).
const cert = await fetchVeilCertificate(requestId);

try {
  const result = await client.verifyCertificate(cert, {
    witnessKeyId: 'witness_v1',
    witnessPublicKey: process.env.VEIL_WITNESS_PUBLIC_KEY_BASE64!,
  });
  // result.witnessAssertedIssuedAtIso preserves full nanosecond precision;
  // result.witnessAssertedIssuedAt is the millisecond-truncated Date form.
  console.log('verified', result.certificateId, result.witnessAssertedIssuedAtIso);
} catch (err) {
  if (err instanceof TheVeilCertificateError) {
    switch (err.reason) {
      case 'malformed':
      case 'unsupported_protocol_version':
      case 'witness_mismatch':
      case 'witness_signature_missing':
      case 'invalid_signature':
        console.error(`verify failed (${err.reason}):`, err.message);
        break;
    }
    return;
  }
  throw err;
}
```
