# Custom PyPI OIDC + twine publish — design note

**Status:** Phase 1 design locked. Awaits external Codex re-review before Phase 2 (implementation).
**Scope:** Python SDK (`theveil` on PyPI) publish workflow only. Does not touch `publish-ts.yml` or `publish-go.yml`.
**Supersedes:** `.github/workflows/publish-python.yml`'s `- uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@<sha>` step only. Everything else in that workflow (trigger pattern, environment, permissions, build step) is retained.
**Branch:** `arc/custom-pypi-oidc-publish` off `main` at `971066e`.

## Decisions locked

All 7 decisions from Section 8 are locked. Summary for quick reference; detailed reasoning retained in Section 8.

| # | Topic | Locked choice |
|---|---|---|
| 8.1 | Attestations | **A** — accept attestation loss; sigstore attestations as separate fast-follow arc, now tracked by issue #20 |
| 8.2 | `--skip-existing` | **A** — omit the flag; duplicate-version upload fails hard |
| 8.3 | twine hash-pinning | **A** — version pin only (`twine==6.2.0`); `--require-hashes` filed as hardening backlog item alongside Dependabot |
| 8.4 | Smoke-test change pairing | **(a)** — add `python/SECURITY.md`, referencing Clario security posture |
| 8.5 | Single vs split step | **B (overridden from design recommendation A)** — two steps: mint step outputs masked token → upload step consumes via step-scoped `env:`. Rationale: split failure modes yield clearer `::error::` annotations in the Actions UI |
| 8.6 | Upload URL | **Hardcode** `https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/` (self-documenting, immune to twine default changes) |
| 8.7 | Retain `environment: pypi` | **Yes** — load-bearing for OIDC claim verification on PyPI side; do not touch |

## 1. Why (not what)

### What issue #19 says

`pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish` is a GitHub Actions *composite* action. The outer composite (`action.yml`) is SHA-pinned by us at `cef221092ed1bacb1cc03d23a2d87d1d172e277b` (v1.14.0, the current head of the `release/v1` branch) in PR #18. That pin protects the outer orchestration code. Inside the composite, the `Create Docker container action` step runs `create-docker-action.py`, which writes a trampoline sub-action at `.github/.tmp/.generated-actions/run-pypi-publish-in-docker-container/action.yml`. The body of that generated sub-action — verbatim from `create-docker-action.py:15-17` — is:

```python
def set_image(ref: str, repo: str, repo_id: str) -> str:
    if repo_id == REPO_ID_GH_ACTION:
        return str(ACTION_SHELL_CHECKOUT_PATH / 'Dockerfile')
    docker_ref = ref.replace('/', '-')
    return f'docker://ghcr.io/{repo}:{docker_ref}'
```

For external consumers (us), `repo_id != REPO_ID_GH_ACTION` (178055147), so the fallback branch runs and the generated sub-action references `docker://ghcr.io/pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish:<ref>` — a **Docker registry tag**, not a digest. Even when we pin the outer action at a 40-character commit SHA, the Docker reference resolves through the `ghcr.io` registry, which serves whatever image is currently tagged with that string. An attacker with push access to `ghcr.io/pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish` (or an exploited GHCR registry vulnerability) can repoint that tag to a malicious image. Our SHA pin protects us against a repo-level compromise of `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish` but does nothing for a GHCR tag-repoint.

**Blast radius if exploited:** the malicious image runs inside our Python publish job with `id-token: write` + `environment: pypi`. It can mint a short-lived PyPI trusted-publishing token for `theveil` and upload any arbitrary package content to the name `theveil` on PyPI. Every user who subsequently runs `pip install theveil` ingests that payload.

### What the custom flow replaces (and does NOT replace)

**Replaces:**
- The single `- uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@<sha>` step in `publish-python.yml`.
- Its transitive Docker pull of `docker://ghcr.io/pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish:<mutable-tag>`.

**Does NOT replace:**
- `twine` (the actual upload library — still a dependency, now installed directly via `pip` into the job runtime).
- `curl` (used for the OIDC exchange — pre-installed on `ubuntu-latest`).
- `jq` (used to parse JSON responses — pre-installed on `ubuntu-latest`).
- The PyPI registry endpoints (`/_/oidc/mint-token`, `upload.pypi.org/legacy/`) — these are first-party PyPI infrastructure; we depend on them regardless of which client does the upload.
- GitHub's OIDC endpoint (`$ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_URL`) — first-party GitHub infrastructure.
- `actions/setup-python` — still needed to bring a pinned CPython + pip into the job. Already SHA-pinned by PR #18.

### Is the supply-chain surface unambiguously smaller?

**Before** (current `publish-python.yml`, after PR #18):

| Artifact | Pin form | Trust anchor |
|---|---|---|
| `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish` | SHA pin | GitHub (outer action code) |
| `docker://ghcr.io/pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish:<tag>` | Mutable tag | **GHCR registry — mutable** |
| `twine` (inside Docker image) | Pinned in `requirements/runtime.txt` inside the image | Docker image content |
| `pypi_attestations`, `sigstore`, `requests`, `id` (inside image) | Pinned in image's requirements | Docker image content |
| Python 3.13-slim base image (per `Dockerfile:1`) | Tag `python:3.13-slim` — mutable | Docker Hub |

**After** (Option A, no attestations — recommended):

Resolved in an isolated venv on 2026-04-21 with `pip install twine==6.2.0`; only `twine` itself is directly pinned. Every transitive package below resolves fresh from PyPI at workflow runtime and is therefore a trust anchor without hash pinning (per locked decision 8.3).

| Artifact | Version / resolution mode | Trust anchor |
|---|---|---|
| `twine` | `6.2.0` direct version pin | PyPI at workflow runtime; direct dependency is version-pinned, not hash-pinned |
| `readme-renderer` | `44.0` observed 2026-04-21; transitive fresh resolve | PyPI at workflow runtime; transitive dependency, not hash-pinned |
| `nh3` | `0.3.4` observed 2026-04-21; transitive fresh resolve | PyPI at workflow runtime; transitive dependency, not hash-pinned |
| `docutils` | `0.22.4` observed 2026-04-21; transitive fresh resolve | PyPI at workflow runtime; transitive dependency, not hash-pinned |
| `Pygments` | `2.20.0` observed 2026-04-21; transitive fresh resolve | PyPI at workflow runtime; transitive dependency, not hash-pinned |
| `requests` | `2.33.1` observed 2026-04-21; transitive fresh resolve | PyPI at workflow runtime; transitive dependency, not hash-pinned |
| `charset-normalizer` | `3.4.7` observed 2026-04-21; transitive fresh resolve | PyPI at workflow runtime; transitive dependency, not hash-pinned |
| `idna` | `3.11` observed 2026-04-21; transitive fresh resolve | PyPI at workflow runtime; transitive dependency, not hash-pinned |
| `urllib3` | `2.6.3` observed 2026-04-21; transitive fresh resolve | PyPI at workflow runtime; transitive dependency, not hash-pinned |
| `certifi` | `2026.2.25` observed 2026-04-21; transitive fresh resolve | PyPI at workflow runtime; transitive dependency, not hash-pinned |
| `requests-toolbelt` | `1.0.0` observed 2026-04-21; transitive fresh resolve | PyPI at workflow runtime; transitive dependency, not hash-pinned |
| `keyring` | `25.7.0` observed 2026-04-21 on the GitHub-hosted x86_64 runner path; conditional transitive fresh resolve | PyPI at workflow runtime; transitive dependency, not hash-pinned |
| `jaraco.classes` | `3.4.0` observed 2026-04-21; transitive fresh resolve | PyPI at workflow runtime; transitive dependency, not hash-pinned |
| `jaraco.functools` | `4.4.0` observed 2026-04-21; transitive fresh resolve | PyPI at workflow runtime; transitive dependency, not hash-pinned |
| `jaraco.context` | `6.1.2` observed 2026-04-21; transitive fresh resolve | PyPI at workflow runtime; transitive dependency, not hash-pinned |
| `more-itertools` | `11.0.2` observed 2026-04-21; transitive fresh resolve | PyPI at workflow runtime; transitive dependency, not hash-pinned |
| `rfc3986` | `2.0.0` observed 2026-04-21; transitive fresh resolve | PyPI at workflow runtime; transitive dependency, not hash-pinned |
| `rich` | `15.0.0` observed 2026-04-21; transitive fresh resolve | PyPI at workflow runtime; transitive dependency, not hash-pinned |
| `markdown-it-py` | `4.0.0` observed 2026-04-21; transitive fresh resolve | PyPI at workflow runtime; transitive dependency, not hash-pinned |
| `mdurl` | `0.1.2` observed 2026-04-21; transitive fresh resolve | PyPI at workflow runtime; transitive dependency, not hash-pinned |
| `packaging` | `26.1` observed 2026-04-21; transitive fresh resolve | PyPI at workflow runtime; transitive dependency, not hash-pinned |
| `id` | `1.6.1` observed 2026-04-21; transitive fresh resolve | PyPI at workflow runtime; transitive dependency, not hash-pinned |
| `curl` | Pre-installed on runner | GitHub Actions runner image |
| `jq` | Pre-installed on runner | GitHub Actions runner image |
| PyPI endpoints | First-party | PyPI |
| GitHub OIDC endpoint | First-party | GitHub |

The `pip install twine==6.2.0` step resolves transitive dependencies from PyPI at workflow runtime. Each resolution is a trust anchor; none are hash-pinned (per locked decision 8.3).

**Net verdict:** smaller in the targeted dimension addressed by issue #19: the mutable GHCR Docker reference is eliminated, along with the action image's transitive mutable Docker base-image dependency. The replacement introduces a new mutable runtime surface because `pip install twine==6.2.0` resolves a transitive dependency tree at workflow runtime. The trade-off is still favorable because the removed surface is a single mutable Docker tag with high blast radius, while the added surface is bounded to the `pip install` step and inherits the same trust model already accepted across Python package installation generally.

**After** (Option B, with sigstore attestations): adds `sigstore==<pinned>` and `pypi-attestations==<pinned>` on top of Option A's runtime-resolved tree. It still removes the mutable container indirection addressed by issue #19, but increases the PyPI-resolved runtime surface versus Option A.

## 2. The OIDC exchange flow

Reference: `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@cef22109.../oidc-exchange.py`. The flow below is a faithful replication of that script's behavior in bash, with explicit field names and HTTP mechanics.

### Step 2.1 — Why this design does NOT do audience discovery

PyPI's Trusted Publishing docs explicitly show `audience=pypi` for PyPI and reserve `/_/oidc/audience` for cases where a client needs to support multiple indices such as PyPI plus TestPyPI. This design is PyPI-only and already hardcodes `https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/` per locked decision 8.6, so a discovery call would add an extra HTTP round-trip without changing the chosen audience. The normative behavior in this design is therefore: **hardcode `audience=pypi`; do not call `GET https://pypi.org/_/oidc/audience` during the workflow.**

Reference: <https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/using-a-publisher/>

### Step 2.2 — Request GitHub OIDC JWT

GitHub injects two env vars on jobs with `permissions: id-token: write`:

- `ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_URL` — the JWT request URL, **already containing query parameters** (the string ends with `?api-version=2.0&...` or similar opaque Microsoft-internal query params). The `audience` parameter is appended with `&audience=<value>`, **never `?audience=`**.
- `ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_TOKEN` — a bearer token used to authenticate the JWT request.

Request:

```
GET ${ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_URL}&audience=pypi
Authorization: bearer ${ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_TOKEN}
```

**Expected response** (HTTP 200, JSON):

```json
{"value": "<signed-jwt>"}
```

The JWT's claims (extractable by base64-decoding the middle segment) include: `sub`, `aud`, `iss`, `repository`, `repository_owner`, `repository_owner_id`, `workflow_ref`, `job_workflow_ref`, `ref`, `environment`. PyPI verifies these against the trusted-publisher configuration to decide whether to mint a token.

**Failure modes:**
- **HTTP non-2xx** (401, 403, 5xx, or anything else) — fail hard. Most likely causes: missing `id-token: write`, workflow triggered by a fork PR (GitHub denies OIDC on fork PRs even when permissions look right), or transient GitHub issue.
- **Missing `value` field** — malformed. Fail hard.
- **Null `value` field** — same. Fail hard.
- **Rate limit** — should not be hit in practice; each tag push is one JWT request. If ever hit, fail hard.

### Step 2.3 — Exchange OIDC JWT for PyPI token

Request:

```
POST https://pypi.org/_/oidc/mint-token
Content-Type: application/json

{"token": "<signed-jwt-from-step-2.2>"}
```

**Expected response** (HTTP 200, JSON):

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "token": "pypi-AgEI...",
  "expires": 1234567890,
  "message": "...",
  "errors": []
}
```

The minted token is a standard PyPI API token (prefix `pypi-`). Lifetime per PyPI: ~15 minutes (PyPI docs-stated; the exact value is controlled by the `expires` field but is tight enough that we cannot reuse across jobs).

**Failure modes:**
- **HTTP 403** — trusted-publisher misconfigured: typically audience mismatch, wrong workflow filename, wrong environment, or claim mismatch. PyPI returns a JSON body with `errors: [{"code": "...", "description": "..."}]` — fail hard and print the errors verbatim + the JWT claims (extracted from the JWT payload) so the operator can diagnose which claim mismatched.
- **HTTP 422** — malformed request body. Should never happen in a well-formed script; fail hard.
- **HTTP 5xx** — PyPI outage. Fail hard.
- **Malformed JSON response** — catch the JSON parse error and fail hard with `status_code` + the first 500 bytes of the raw response body (truncated to avoid log bloat).
- **Response 200 but `token` field missing/null** — fail hard; this should be impossible but would be a silent PyPI regression.
- **Clock skew** — the JWT includes `iat`/`exp` claims. GitHub Actions runner clocks are synced against NTP; skew is never a realistic cause of `exp` rejection. If it ever becomes one, PyPI's 403 response will make the cause clear.

### Step 2.4 — Token masking and scoping (two-step flow — locked per 8.5)

The workflow is split across two distinct steps (per 8.5 = B):

- **Step A (mint):** performs 2.2 → 2.3; at the end, masks the minted token and writes it to the step's output. Upload artefacts are NOT touched in this step.
- **Step B (upload):** consumes the token from Step A's output into its step-scoped `env:` block, runs `twine check` + `twine upload`, exits.

**Token masking — ordering invariant:**

The masking command MUST execute BEFORE the token is written anywhere the runner can log. Concretely, Step A's bash body is structured so that `::add-mask::<token>` is emitted to stderr before either `echo "token=<val>" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"` or any other write. Failing to order this correctly would leak the token to the raw log before the scrubber learns about it.

```bash
# (inside Step A, after parsing the mint response)
printf '::add-mask::%s\n' "$PYPI_TOKEN" 1>&2
printf 'token=%s\n' "$PYPI_TOKEN" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
```

**Step-output handling (the overridden concern):**

`$GITHUB_OUTPUT` writes are durable within the job's step-output map and are consumable by later steps via `${{ steps.mint.outputs.token }}`. The runner applies masking to the stored value across the job lifetime — any subsequent log statement that emits the masked string is scrubbed. Known footguns handled:

- **Step summaries:** the runner's step-summary feature renders `GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` markdown, NOT step outputs. The minted token is never written to `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`. Codex should verify this invariant in the implemented YAML.
- **Log echo on output write:** the runner does not echo `GITHUB_OUTPUT` lines to the log. The `printf 'token=...' >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"` line produces no log output. Verified against the pypa action's own token-handling (it prints the token to stdout where `twine-upload.sh` captures it via `$(python /app/oidc-exchange.py)`; our split-step variant is materially more explicit about masking).
- **Job-level `env:`:** never used for the token. Only the upload step's own `env:` block gets `TWINE_PASSWORD: ${{ steps.mint.outputs.token }}`. This scopes the token to Step B's process tree; no other step (present or future) sees it.

**Scoping rules (locked):**

- Token is written ONLY to `$GITHUB_OUTPUT` of the mint step, and masked before that write.
- Token is NEVER written to disk (`~/.pypirc`, `/tmp/token`, environment files on disk).
- Token is NEVER written to `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` or `$GITHUB_ENV`.
- Token is NEVER passed to any step other than Step B (upload).
- Step B's `env:` block for `TWINE_PASSWORD` is scoped to that step's `run:` only, never to the job.

### Step 2.4.1 — Shell tracing prohibition

Any step that references the minted token MUST NOT enable shell tracing. Specifically:

- MUST NOT use `set -x`
- MUST NOT use `set -v`
- MUST NOT use `bash -x`
- MUST NOT use `sh -x`
- Step-level `shell: bash` is permitted; `shell: bash -x` or equivalent is prohibited
- If debugging is needed, add step-specific `echo` statements with explicit variable names and safe redactions, never global tracing

**Trade-off accepted (per 8.5 override):** two-step split means the token persists in the job's step-output map for the lifetime of the job (several seconds between Step A and Step B). The single-step alternative would have held the token in a bash shell variable for a shorter lifetime. Marc's override prioritizes operator debuggability (Step A failure surfaces distinct from Step B failure in the Actions UI) over the marginally-shorter token lifetime. Codex should flag if the job-level step-output exposure is larger than expected — but under current GitHub Actions runner semantics, a masked step output is scrubbed consistently and cannot be exfiltrated by a later step unless that step explicitly writes the token to a new surface, which this design forbids.

## 3. twine invocation

Path convention for this section: all distribution artifact references are written explicitly as `python/dist/*`. Phase 2 must preserve that explicit artifact selection even if a step inherits `working-directory: python`, by overriding or compensating locally rather than reverting the design note back to `dist/*`.

This design relies on GitHub-hosted runners being ephemeral, so `python/dist/` is assumed to start fresh on each run and no explicit `rm -rf python/dist/` step is specified. Self-hosted runner workspace hygiene is out of scope for this arc.

### Version pin

**twine 6.2.0** (latest stable at design time, 2026-04-21; verified via `curl https://pypi.org/pypi/twine/json | jq -r .info.version`).

`twine 6.2.0` was released on 2025-09-04, roughly 7 months before this design, and is still the current latest stable release per live PyPI JSON. Twine's release cadence is slow; age alone is not a red flag here.

Requires Python >= 3.9; our workflow already pins `python-version: '3.12'` via `actions/setup-python`, so the Python requirement is trivially satisfied.

### Install mechanics

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install 'twine==6.2.0'
```

This install inherits the trust model of the PyPI registry itself. If an attacker controls DNS for `pypi.org` or a configured upstream mirror, the impact is ecosystem-wide rather than unique to this workflow. That risk is accepted here; this arc does not introduce a one-off mirror trust exception.

**Hash-pinning — LOCKED per 8.3 = A:** version pin only (`twine==6.2.0`), no constraints file, no `--require-hashes`. Hash-pinning is tracked as a hardening backlog item alongside Dependabot enablement — both land uniformly across all three SDKs' CI workflows in a later arc, not just this one.

Reasoning retained for audit:
- **A — version pin only** (locked): simple; any transitive-dependency hijack on PyPI could slip malicious code into the runtime. Low probability given twine's small transitive graph and PyPI's Sigstore attestations on modern releases.
- **B — `--require-hashes` with a vendored `python/constraints/publish-requirements.txt`** (deferred): each direct + transitive dep pinned to a SHA-256 hash; refuses to install anything not in the file. Requires periodic regeneration via `pip-compile --generate-hashes`; drift is failure-closed but has an operational cost.

### Pre-upload check

Always run `twine check` before upload. It validates distribution metadata (`long_description` renders correctly on PyPI, required metadata fields present, wheel tag sanity). Does not verify signatures or hit the network. Fast, no side effects.

```bash
twine check python/dist/*
```

Exits 0 on success; non-zero on any metadata issue. Failure halts the job.

### Upload invocation

```bash
TWINE_USERNAME=__token__ \
TWINE_PASSWORD="$PYPI_TOKEN" \
TWINE_REPOSITORY_URL=https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/ \
  twine upload --non-interactive --disable-progress-bar python/dist/*
```

- `TWINE_USERNAME=__token__` + `TWINE_PASSWORD=<token>` is the canonical way to pass an API token. `twine-upload.sh:165-167` at the pinned SHA uses exactly this pattern.
- `TWINE_REPOSITORY_URL=https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/` — explicit PyPI upload endpoint. Matches the default in `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish/action.yml:14`.
- `--non-interactive` — never prompt; any auth failure exits non-zero instead of hanging.
- `--disable-progress-bar` — avoids TTY-shaped output in the CI log.
- Artifact selection is always written as `python/dist/*` in this design note, even where the eventual workflow step may inherit `working-directory: python`.

### `--skip-existing` — LOCKED per 8.2 = A

**Locked: omit `--skip-existing`.** Duplicate-version upload fails hard with twine exit code 1 and PyPI HTTP 400. Recovery is an explicit version bump. Silent-skip would hide real version-bump bugs.

Reasoning retained for audit:
- **A — omit** (locked): fail-hard on duplicate; forces operator to bump version rather than silently no-op.
- **B — include** (rejected): idempotent retries; hides state confusion.

---

## 4. Attestation / sigstore — LOCKED per 8.1 = A

**Locked: ship without PEP 740 attestations initially.** Sigstore attestations are tracked as a separate fast-follow arc in issue #20. Reasoning from both options retained below for audit — the original option comparison drove the locked decision and is preserved as design evidence.

**Narrative-mismatch note (do not forget):** The Veil's product pitch is cryptographically-verifiable provenance for AI inference. Shipping Python SDK without PEP 740 attestations is a thematic off-key. The TS SDK has npm auto-provenance; the Python SDK must reach PEP 740 parity before the post-Clario customer engagement cycle widens. That fast-follow is now tracked by issue #20 and scheduled for the post-Clario hardening sprint.

### Background

PEP 740 (Final, accepted 2024-07-17) defines a wire format for per-file digital attestations on Python package indices. The current `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@v1.14.0` generates PEP 740 attestations automatically when all of the following are true (per `action.yml:72-75` + `twine-upload.sh` logic):

1. Trusted Publishing flow is active (no `INPUT_PASSWORD` supplied by the caller).
2. The index URL matches `pypi.org` or `test.pypi.org`.
3. `attestations: true` (the default).

When active, the action invokes `attestations.py` inside the Docker container, which:

- Uses `sigstore.sign.Signer` with `ClientTrustConfig.production()` to sign each dist file.
- Obtains a *separate* OIDC credential with audience `sigstore` (not `pypi`) to identify the signer.
- Writes a `<dist>.publish.attestation` JSON file alongside each dist.
- Relies on twine's `--attestations` flag (supported in twine 6.x) to include those attestations in the upload multipart form.

PyPI then exposes the attestations on a `<dist>.provenance` URL and a `data-provenance` Simple Index attribute. Consumers verify via the PEP 740 in-toto DSSE chain rooted at the Sigstore public instance.

### Option A — Accept attestation loss for initial landing

**What is lost:** PEP 740 attestations on `theveil` dists published via this workflow.

**What remains:**
- Trusted Publishing (OIDC-minted tokens) still used — unchanged from today.
- Users can still verify package origin via PyPI's existing metadata (PEP 458 once PyPI enables it, PyPI's own account-level signing, etc.).
- The package is still legitimately ours — there is no authenticity loss, only loss of the cryptographic *attestation* artifact that a third-party verifier can check offline.
- The PyPI package page will not display the "signed" badge that PEP 740 attestations trigger.
- Consumers who explicitly check PyPI provenance or badge state MAY see that absence as unexpected.

**Impact on The Veil's pitch:** The Veil's product narrative is cryptographically-verifiable provenance for AI inference. Shipping our Python SDK *without* a cryptographic provenance attestation is thematically off-key. Any customer who inspects our package on PyPI and notices the absence of a provenance badge (which PyPI shows when attestations are present) would have a legitimate question. However:
- The TS SDK on npm already publishes with provenance attestations (automatic via npm trusted publishing, PR #16).
- The Go SDK has no equivalent attestation mechanism on the Go proxy — there's nothing to lose.
- So the gap is Python-only, and only until Option B is landed.

**User-visible disclosure:** the smoke-test-paired `python/SECURITY.md` file from locked decision 8.4 will include a line stating that Python SDK publishes currently ship without PEP 740 attestations and linking to issue #20. That is the only intended user-visible disclosure. PyPI provides no upload-time mechanism to mark attestation absence as intentional.

**Effort to revisit:** Low. Adding sigstore signing to the custom flow is a separable arc (install sigstore + pypi-attestations, run `python -m sigstore sign` or call the pypi-attestations API, pass `--attestations` to twine). No design refactor needed; issue #20 is the tracking handle.

### Option B — Add explicit sigstore signing now

**What is added** to the custom flow:

1. Install `sigstore==<pinned>` + `pypi-attestations==<pinned>` alongside twine.
2. After the build step, before the upload step:
   - Obtain a *second* GitHub OIDC JWT with audience `sigstore` (separate from the `pypi` JWT already obtained for the mint-token call).
   - Invoke sigstore's signer to produce `<dist>.publish.attestation` sidecars.
3. Invoke twine with `--attestations`, which includes the sidecars in the upload multipart form.

**Added supply-chain surface:**
- `sigstore` Python package — recent versions are small and have few transitive deps, but still a nonzero addition.
- `pypi-attestations` Python package — small, PyPA-maintained.
- Sigstore root-of-trust bundle (shipped inside `sigstore` package via `ClientTrustConfig.production()`).
- Sigstore OIDC issuance + Rekor log — same infrastructure we already rely on for the Go SDK's DSA backend certificate attestations (memory `project_dsa_48_49_rekor_hashedrekord_shipped.md`). Not a *new* trust anchor at the org level; familiar infrastructure.

**Hash-pinning recommendation:** If Option B is chosen, the `--require-hashes` constraints file (Section 3 decision) becomes more important — sigstore has a larger transitive graph than twine alone, and the whole point of attestations is to tighten the trust chain.

**Timing-failure consideration:** Sigstore signing can fail independently of twine upload. Specifically: signing happens *before* upload (in the twine invocation sequence). If signing fails, we fail hard *before* any network request to PyPI; no mixed state is possible. If twine upload fails *after* signing succeeded, we have a `.publish.attestation` file on the runner that never gets uploaded — no harm, runner state is ephemeral.

**Unlikely but specific failure mode:** sigstore is rate-limited; a tag push storm (shouldn't happen for us) would hit it. Mitigation: none needed at our volume.

### Locked rationale (A)

The locked decision (A) was chosen for the following reasons, preserved here as the audit trail:

- Option A ships the security fix (issue #19) immediately with minimum change. Smaller diff, simpler review, fewer moving parts on the first smoke test.
- The attestation-narrative mismatch is real but mitigable via the Option A → Option B fast-follow arc (trivial add, not a rewrite); attestations land within the following arc cycle.
- Shipping sigstore on the first smoke test would add a second failure axis. If the smoke test breaks (Section 6), the operator would have to diagnose "was it the OIDC flow or the sigstore integration?" Option A localizes the smoke-test failure space to the OIDC flow alone.
- The TS and Go SDKs are already proving the OIDC pattern; the Python smoke-testing of OIDC alone is analogous.

---

## 5. Failure modes and recovery

The custom flow has fewer failure surfaces than the current action (no Docker pull, no attestation generation — per decision 8.1 = A), so the enumeration is short.

**Two-step structure consequence (per 8.5 = B locked):** 5.0 and 5.0.1 are pre-publish prerequisite failures. 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.3.1, and 5.4 are Step A failures — they surface as step-level `::error::` annotations on the "Mint PyPI token via OIDC" step in the Actions UI. 5.6 and 5.7 are Step B failures — they surface on the "twine check + upload" step. 5.5 may affect either step. This clean split is the operational reason 8.5 was overridden to B: a red marker on Step A tells the operator "OIDC / trusted-publisher problem", a red marker on Step B tells them "build artefact or PyPI upload problem" — without the operator having to parse step logs to distinguish.

### 5.0 — `twine` install failure

- **Observable:** `python -m pip install 'twine==6.2.0'` exits non-zero.
- **Common causes:** PyPI transient 5xx, DNS failure, stale pip cache, conflicting transitive dependency resolution.
- **Log:** pip's native error output plus `::error::Failed to install twine==6.2.0; see pip output above`.
- **Recovery:** fail hard; upstream workflow re-run is the recovery path.
- **Retry policy:** no workflow-level retry. pip already performs its own internal retries; adding an outer retry risks masking a systemic issue.

### 5.0.1 — Build failure

- **Observable:** `python -m build` exits non-zero; `python/dist/` is empty or incomplete.
- **Log:** the build tool's native output plus `::error::Build failed; python/dist/ will not be uploaded`.
- **Recovery:** fail hard; downstream `twine check` and `twine upload` steps do not execute.
- **Pytest retention:** the existing `pytest` step MUST pass before build runs. If `pytest` fails, build does not run.

### 5.1 — GitHub OIDC JWT request fails

- **Observable:** `curl` exits non-zero, or GitHub returns HTTP non-2xx, or response body has no `.value` field, or `.value` is null.
- **Log:** `::error::GitHub OIDC token request failed: <http-status> <body-excerpt>` plus a reminder that `id-token: write` must be granted at the job level and that fork-PR triggers are disallowed.
- **Recovery:** job halts. Most common cause: accidental removal of `id-token: write`. Fork-PR case is already handled by our trigger pattern (`tags: ['python/v*']`, `workflow_dispatch`) — forks cannot push tags to our repo, so this path is unreachable for external PRs.

### 5.2 — PyPI token mint returns 403

- **Observable:** HTTP 403 from `/_/oidc/mint-token`. Response body is JSON of shape `{"errors": [{"code": "...", "description": "..."}]}`.
- **Log:** `::error::PyPI token mint refused:` followed by each error's code + description + the claims extracted from the JWT payload (decoded from base64), so the operator can compare against the trusted-publisher configuration on PyPI.
- **Recovery:** job halts. Recovery requires updating the trusted-publisher configuration on `https://pypi.org/manage/project/theveil/settings/publishing/` to match the current workflow's claims (owner, repository, workflow filename, environment).

### 5.3 — PyPI token mint returns 4xx/5xx other than 403

- **Observable:** HTTP 422 or 5xx from `/_/oidc/mint-token`.
- **Log:** `::error::PyPI token mint failed: status=<N> body-head=<first-500-chars>`.
- **Recovery:** fail hard. HTTP 422 signals a request-construction bug; 5xx signals PyPI outage. Upstream tag re-push or manual workflow re-run is the only recovery after the underlying cause is understood.

### 5.3.1 — Mint POST transport failure

- **Observable:** `curl` exit code is non-zero before any HTTP status is returned. Notable codes: `6` = DNS failure, `7` = connection refused, `28` = timeout, `35` = TLS handshake failure, `56` = network receive error.
- **Log:** `::error::PyPI mint-token transport failure: curl exited with code $EXIT_CODE`, followed by the captured `curl` stderr.
- **Recovery:** fail hard; no automatic retry. Recovery is an upstream tag re-push or manual workflow re-run once the transport issue is resolved.
- **Diagnostic hint:** point the operator at `status.python.org` from the workflow log before retrying.

### 5.4 — PyPI token mint returns 2xx but malformed JSON

- **Observable:** HTTP 2xx but `jq` exits non-zero, or the `.token` field is missing/null.
- **Log:** `::error::PyPI mint-token malformed response: status=<N> body-head=<first-500-chars>`.
- **Recovery:** job halts. Signals PyPI configuration drift or transient PyPI bug. Retry after a few minutes.

### 5.5 — `curl`, `jq`, or `python` missing on runner

- **Assumption:** `ubuntu-latest` runner images include `curl`, `jq`, and `python3` pre-installed. GitHub's documented runner image manifest confirms this.
- **If violated:** `::error::missing prerequisite: <tool>`. Job halts. Recovery: add explicit apt install step. Not expected to happen in practice — but the assumption is stated here so Codex can push back if wrong.

### 5.6 — `twine check` fails

- **Observable:** twine exits non-zero on metadata validation.
- **Log:** twine's own error output surfaces to the runner log.
- **Recovery:** job halts before any PyPI network request — safe, no partial state. Fix: correct the package metadata in `pyproject.toml` (most commonly malformed `long_description` or missing `license` field) and re-tag.

### 5.7 — `twine upload` partial success

- **PyPI's behavior on duplicate upload:** PyPI rejects subsequent uploads of the *same version* (including sdists and wheels with identical filenames), returning HTTP 400 with a `File already exists` error message. This is independent of `--skip-existing`.
- **If the job fails mid-upload** (network blip after first wheel uploads but before second): PyPI has the first wheel, we cannot re-upload it, but the sdist or second wheel is missing. The version is effectively broken on PyPI (`pip install` may or may not succeed depending on platform tag match). **Recovery:** bump the version, re-tag, re-run the full upload. Deleting the partial artifact on PyPI requires manual intervention via the PyPI UI and is generally not an operator-allowed path.
- **Mitigation:** accept this failure mode. Version bump is the canonical PyPI remediation across the ecosystem.

### 5.8 — Sigstore signing fails (Option B only)

- **Observable:** sigstore Python lib raises `IdentityError` or signing fails.
- **Log:** `::error::sigstore attestation generation failed: <exception>`.
- **Recovery:** job halts *before* any PyPI upload. No partial state. Fix: diagnose sigstore-side issue (OIDC audience, Rekor log availability) and re-run.

## 6. Testing strategy

### Can this be tested without a real PyPI publish?

**No.** The only authoritative smoke test for the OIDC exchange is a real tag cut against a real PyPI trusted-publisher configuration. Identical to the TS situation (the TS SDK's OIDC flow is not proven until `ts/v0.2.1` is tagged per the separate SDK arc).

Partial testing possibilities considered and rejected as insufficient:
- **Mock the PyPI endpoints** — proves the bash escaping and `jq` parsing but does not exercise the trusted-publisher configuration or PyPI's actual mint logic. Value: near-zero for security hardening.
- **Publish to TestPyPI first** — plausible, but requires a separate trusted-publisher configuration on TestPyPI, and the failure modes on TestPyPI are not always identical to PyPI. Value: marginal; not worth the setup overhead on a one-shot arc.
- **Dry-run via `twine upload --repository test.pypi.org`** — same problem as above, and doesn't exercise our actual PyPI configuration.

### What version gets burned on the smoke test?

**Locked: `python/v0.1.1`** paired with adding `python/SECURITY.md`.

The `python/SECURITY.md` addition is the required real change from locked decision 8.4. It will document the current PEP 740 attestation state, explicitly disclose the temporary absence of PyPI's "signed" badge, and link to issue #20. No alternative smoke-test pairing is in scope for this design revision.

### Rollback path

If the custom flow breaks OIDC publish on the smoke test:
1. The failure is observable within ~30s of the tag push (the OIDC exchange step runs early).
2. **Do not** attempt in-workflow fixes during the failing run. Cancel if still running.
3. **Rollback target:** revert to the merge commit SHA of PR #18 (TBD once PR #18 merges). Specifically, restore the single-line `- uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@cef221092ed1bacb1cc03d23a2d87d1d172e277b` step that PR #18 leaves in place.
4. The rollback is a single commit revert against the eventual Phase 2 merge, not a restoration from memory. A new tag `python/v0.1.2` cut from that revert commit recovers publishing.
5. `v0.1.1` remains broken on PyPI in whatever state it reached (probably "version reserved but no dists published", which is recoverable: the name stays reserved to us and `v0.1.2` supersedes without conflict).
6. Post-mortem diagnoses which step failed. The OIDC mint step is the highest-risk spot — if PyPI returns 403 with a specific `errors[].code`, the trusted-publisher config likely needs re-verification against the new workflow filename.

---

## 7. Explicit non-goals

Phase 2 hard requirement: the existing `pytest` step MUST remain before build. Dropping `pytest` is out of scope; any PR that removes that step is invalid per this design.

This arc does NOT:

- Touch `publish-ts.yml` or `publish-go.yml` (Python-only change).
- Modify any SDK source code (`python/src/theveil/**/*` untouched).
- Add features to the Python SDK (no new public API, no new CLI, no new HTTP endpoints).
- Change the trigger pattern (`tags: ['python/v*']` + `workflow_dispatch` retained).
- Change the `permissions:` block (`id-token: write` + `contents: read` retained).
- Change the `environment: pypi` declaration (retained).
- Change the working directory (`python` retained via `defaults.run.working-directory`).
- Remove or bypass the existing `pytest` step before build.
- Address Dependabot enablement (separate arc; tracked as part of the post-Clario backlog).
- Address broader CI hardening beyond issue #19 (e.g., CodeQL, SAST, secret-scanning, merge protection) — out of scope.
- Make the custom flow available as a reusable action or composite — inlined-only, per-SDK-workflow, no abstraction.
- Bootstrap `theveil` on PyPI if it's not already registered — trusted-publisher configuration must already exist on PyPI (per the current workflow's precondition).

## 8. Decisions (locked)

All 7 decisions are locked. Detailed reasoning preserved below for audit purposes. Summary table lives at the top of the document.

### 8.1 — Attestation decision — **LOCKED: A**

**Option A** (no attestations initially, fast-follow separate arc) **vs. Option B** (sigstore attestations in this arc).

**Locked: A — accept attestation loss for the initial landing.** Sigstore attestations are tracked under fast-follow issue #20. The Python SDK will land on PyPI without PEP 740 attestations until that arc ships.

**Narrative-mismatch note (explicit so it doesn't get forgotten):** The Veil's product pitch is cryptographically-verifiable provenance for AI inference. Shipping the Python SDK without PEP 740 attestations is a thematic off-key. The TS SDK on npm already has provenance attestations via npm's trusted-publisher auto-provenance; the Python SDK should reach parity before the post-Clario customer engagement cycle widens. **Tracked follow-up: issue #20, scheduled for the post-Clario hardening sprint.**

*Original design recommendation: A. No override.*

### 8.2 — `--skip-existing` behavior — **LOCKED: A**

**A** (omit `--skip-existing`, duplicate-version upload fails hard) **vs. B** (include `--skip-existing`, idempotent retries).

**Locked: A — omit the flag.** Duplicate-version upload fails hard with twine exit code 1 and PyPI HTTP 400. Silent-skip hides state confusion on retries and masks real version-bump bugs.

*Original design recommendation: A. No override.*

### 8.3 — twine hash-pinning — **LOCKED: A**

**A** (version pin only: `twine==6.2.0`) **vs. B** (`--require-hashes` with a constraints file).

**Locked: A — version pin only, `twine==6.2.0`, no constraints file, no `--require-hashes`.** Hash-pinning is filed as a **hardening backlog item alongside Dependabot enablement** — both are cross-cutting supply-chain improvements that should land uniformly across all three SDKs' CI workflows, not just this one.

*Original design recommendation: A. No override.*

### 8.4 — Smoke-test version and real change pairing — **LOCKED: (a)**

**Locked: (a) — add `python/SECURITY.md`.** Real content (not a cosmetic version bump), long-term useful documentation, and references Clario security posture. Gives CISOs a document to point at during the post-Clario customer engagement cycle. Aligns with the arc's theme.

The file must include a line that explains the current absence of PEP 740 attestations on PyPI and links to issue #20.

Options considered:
- **(a)** `python/SECURITY.md` documenting attestation status. ✓ LOCKED.
- (b) Bump `pytest>=8.0` to the current stable minor in dev extras.
- (c) Add a docstring to one public Python SDK entry point that lacks one.
- (d) Something else.

*Original design recommendation: (a). No override.*

### 8.5 — Single vs split mint-and-upload steps — **LOCKED: B (OVERRIDDEN from design recommendation A)**

**Locked: B — two steps.** Mint step outputs masked token via `$GITHUB_OUTPUT`; upload step consumes via step-scoped `env:` block.

**Marc's rationale (overriding the design's A recommendation):** split failure modes yield clearer `::error::` annotations in the Actions UI. When a smoke test fails, the operator sees immediately whether the failure was in the OIDC/trusted-publisher path (Step A) or the build-artefact/PyPI-upload path (Step B), without having to parse step logs. Acceptable trade-off: token persists in the job's step-output map for a few seconds between Step A and Step B, rather than in a bash shell variable. Masking via `::add-mask::` before the `$GITHUB_OUTPUT` write is the load-bearing safety measure; the full masking discipline is specified in Section 2.4.

**Design implications of the override (propagated through the note):**
- Section 2.4 rewritten to specify the two-step token-handoff pattern, masking ordering invariant, and the explicit forbidden surfaces (`$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`, `$GITHUB_ENV`, job-level `env:`, disk).
- Section 5 annotated: 5.0 and 5.0.1 are pre-publish prerequisite failures; 5.1–5.4 plus 5.3.1 are Step A failures; 5.6–5.7 are Step B failures; 5.5 may affect either.
- Phase 2 (implementation) must produce a workflow YAML with exactly two publish-related steps (beyond the existing checkout/setup/build/install) and exercise the step-scoped `env:` pattern — not a `run: |` block that performs both mint and upload inline.

*Original design recommendation: A. Overridden to B per Marc.*

### 8.6 — Explicit PyPI upload URL or default — **LOCKED: hardcode**

**Locked: hardcode `TWINE_REPOSITORY_URL=https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/`.** Twine's default URL has shifted historically; hardcoding is self-documenting and immune to twine default changes. Matches the pypa action's explicit value in `action.yml:14`.

*Original design recommendation: hardcode. No override.*

### 8.7 — Retain the `environment: pypi` GitHub environment — **LOCKED: retain**

**Locked: retain.** `publish-python.yml:17`'s `environment: pypi` is load-bearing for the trusted-publisher configuration on PyPI (the environment name is one of the verified claims in the JWT `sub`/`environment` fields). Phase 2 must not touch this declaration. Flagged here so Codex review doesn't misread a "cleanup" opportunity that would break OIDC.

*No decision — retained as originally scoped.*
