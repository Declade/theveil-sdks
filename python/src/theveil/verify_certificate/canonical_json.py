"""Canonical JSON serializer — Python port of the Veil witness signing algorithm.

Byte-identical to:
  dual-sandbox-architecture/pkg/veil/canonical.go
  theveil-sdks/ts/src/verify-certificate/canonical-json.ts

This is NOT RFC 8785 JCS. It is the witness's signing algorithm:
  - recursive sorted keys at every map depth (bytewise UTF-8 sort)
  - leaves through json.dumps(..., ensure_ascii=False, separators=(",", ":"))
    then HTML-safe post-processing to match Go's default json.Marshal
  - Python int emits as integer JSON (e.g. ``2``), preserving Go's
    json.Marshal(int) output. ``float`` is rejected at the boundary to
    prevent accidental float-formatting divergence between languages —
    the Veil signed subset carries no floats.
  - ``bool`` is checked before ``int`` (since ``bool`` subclasses ``int``
    in Python) so ``True``/``False`` emit as ``true``/``false``, not ``1``/``0``.

Output: zero whitespace, no trailing newline, UTF-8 bytes.

Array-of-maps behaviour: Go's marshalSorted does NOT recurse into arrays —
arrays delegate to json.Marshal, which itself alphabetizes map keys. The
Python port reaches sorted-keys through explicit recursion; the
canonical-JSON golden fixture locks in byte-agreement across all three
implementations.
